    <p>If you are looking to start up a website,<br> but are short of ideas of what to present (or just look for niche site ideas),<br>

       <h2>Blog: </h2>
       <img id="blog" src="blog.jpg">
      <p id="para1">If you want to start a website â€“ start a blog!
        <br>
        This is a bulletproof advice for the beginners.
        <br>
        Your first blog is you door to the world of Internet (and most importantly, Internet business).
        <br><br>
        A blog is a great way for beginners to learn about how the web works while posting about their interests, daily activities or hobbies.
        <br>
        The good news is â€“ starting a blog is super easy!
        <br>
        WordPress hosting costs only about $3.95/month. So, you are only a few clicks and 3.95 bucks (a price of a cup of coffee) away from starting your journey as a blogger and future internet entrepreneur! ðŸ™‚
        <br><br>
        We actually started exactly the same way!
        <br>
        There is simply no excuse for not trying this website idea.
        <br>
        Remember, the great things come with a single decision to tryâ€¦
        <br>
        You can start with a very simple website and go from there. Blogging can become extremely profitable once you are familiar with how to market your site.
        <br>
        Some bloggers make millions from their blogs.
        <br><br>
        The Internet is the future. We all know it. The simplest way to get in is to start your own website.
        <br>
        The best time for starting a blog was yesterday. The second best time is now.
        <br>
        If you donâ€™t start today, you risk being late to the party.
        <br>
        So, what you are waiting for?</p><br>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Statistics Website
        </h1>
        <img id="stat" src="Website-Ideas-Statistics.png">
        <p id="para2">This is an absolutely awesome website idea for any beginner. We love publishing stats here at Siteefy too (check our heavily cited all across the web stats pages: Video Marketing Statistics and Mobile Marketing Statistics for inspiration).This is an absolutely awesome website idea for any beginner.

People want information and you can provide that commodity through a website dedicated to statistics generally or in a chosen field. Your goal with this type of website is to become a resource people can rely upon for their own research. You will need to update your website frequently with new statistical information that is accurate.<br><br>

For beginners, creating a website that becomes a commonly-used resource is an excellent way to build up followers. Remember, your product is accurate information, so be sure to check out new statistics before adding them to your site. Successful statistical sites never go out of style, so you have an evergreen website that continues to grow.<br><br>

            <h1>Interview Website</h1>
            <p id="para3">A blog based around interviews with experts in a selected field is quite popular for good reasons. Good interviews provide viewers and listeners with valuable information. Whether you conduct the interviews with emails, podcasts, or videos, getting answers from respected members of a particular industry provides gravitas to your site. Plus, they provide a relatively easy way to gain unique information that helps set your site apart from the competition.<br><br>

                If you want to establish yourself in a particular niche, getting good interviews with respected members of that field can serve as a great website idea.</p><br><br><br>
        <h1>Humour Website</h1><br>
        <p id="para4">Being funny sells, especially if you can create a niche that appeals to a particular interest.<br><br>

            You can choose everyday life, the political realm, celebrities, and entertainment, or whatever your heart desires. If you have a knack for making people laugh, then this is a simple website idea and a great way to earn extra money online.<br><br>
            
            Plus, you can attract others who are funny and have them post on your site. Who knows, this might even evolve into a community one day. With this website idea, you can build up income through ads, sponsored content or selling your own products while making people laugh.<br><br>
            
            However, what is important with this website idea is that you will need to be consistent in your posting, so that people will follow your site regularly.</p><br> <br><br>
           <h1>Leadership blog</h1><br>
           <p id="para5">One of the most popular areas of self-improvement is becoming a better leader.<br><br>

            You can use examples from your own life and combine them with tried and true methods to create a leadership blog. Your product is information and your pitch is the personal angle you put on becoming a better leader. This means your site can use famous quotes and aphorisms, proven techniques, and personal guidance to help others fully realize their leadership qualities.<br><br>
            
            It helps if you can find a specific niche, but what you really need is dedication and persistence which are qualities of good leadership.</p><br> <br><br>
        <h1>Quotes and Aphorisms</h1><br>
        <p id="para6">It seems that every day people are looking up famous quotes and aphorisms to use in their books, reports, and sites. By providing a single location, you can tap into a considerable audience and build up the visitors to your site.<br><br>

            You probably want to start with popular quotes and aphorisms that pertain to a specific area or subject. However, you can quite branch out once you have maximized the potential of one area.<br><br>
            
            All you need is an angle, the proper research, and attribution to get going. Just keep in mind that you have plenty of competition.</p><br> <br><br>
